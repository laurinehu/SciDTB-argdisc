In this paper we examine the lexical substitution task for the medical domain . <S>
We adapt the current best system from the open domain , 
which trains a single classifier for all instances 
using delexicalized features . <S>
We show significant improvements over a strong baseline 
coming from a distributional thesaurus ( DT ) . <S>
Whereas in the open domain system , 
features 
derived from WordNet 
show only slight improvements , 
we show 
that its counterpart for the medical domain ( UMLS ) shows a significant additional benefit 
when used for feature generation . <S>
