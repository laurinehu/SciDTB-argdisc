There has been almost no work on phrase structure annotation and parsing 
specially designed for learner English 
despite the fact 
that they are useful for representing the structural characteristics of learner English . <S>
To address this problem , 
in this paper , we first propose a phrase structure annotation scheme for learner English 
and annotate two different learner corpora 
using it . <S>
Second , we show their usefulness , 
reporting on ( a ) inter-annotator agreement rate , ( b ) characteristic CFG rules in the corpora , and ( c ) parsing performance on them . <S>
In addition ,  we explore methods 
to improve phrase structure parsing for learner English 
( achieving an F-measure of 0.878 ) . <S>
Finally , we release the full annotation guidelines , the annotated data , and the improved parser model for learner English to the public . <S>
