Named Entity Disambiguation ( NED ) algorithms disambiguate mentions of named entities with respect to a knowledge-base , 
but sometimes the context might be poor or misleading . <S>
In this paper we introduce the acquisition of two kinds of background information 
to alleviate that problem : 
entity similarity and selectional preferences for syntactic positions . <S>
We show , 
using a generative Naive Bayes model for NED , 
that the additional sources of context are complementary , 
and improve results in the CoNLL 2003 and TAC KBP DEL 2014 datasets , 
yielding the third best and the best results , respectively . <S>
We provide examples and analysis 
which show the value of the acquired background information . <S>
