Activities and events in our lives are structural , 
be it a vacation , a camping trip , or a wedding . <S>
While individual details vary , 
there are characteristic patterns 
that are specific to each of these scenarios . <S>
For example , a wedding typically consists of a sequence of events 
such as walking down the aisle , exchanging vows , and dancing . <S>
In this paper , we present a data-driven approach 
to learning event knowledge from a large collection of photo albums . <S>
We formulate the task as constrained optimization 
to induce the prototypical temporal structure of an event , 
integrating both visual and textual cues . <S>
Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates 
that it is possible to learn multimodal knowledge of event structure from noisy web content . <S>
