We present an approach 
for learning context-dependent semantic parsers 
to identify and interpret time expressions . <S>
We use a Combinatory Categorial Grammar 
to construct compositional meaning representations , 
while considering contextual cues , such as the document creation time and the tense of the governing verb , 
to compute the final time values . <S>
Experiments on benchmark datasets show 
that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art systems , with error reductions of 13 % to 21 % in end-to-end performance . <S>
