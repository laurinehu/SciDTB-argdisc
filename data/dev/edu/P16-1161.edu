Discriminative translation models 
utilizing source context 
have been shown to help statistical machine translation performance . <S>
We propose a novel extension of this work 
using target context information . <S>
Surprisingly , we show 
that this model can be efficiently integrated directly in the decoding process . <S>
Our approach scales to large training data sizes 
and results in consistent improvements in translation quality on four language pairs . <S>
We also provide an analysis 
comparing the strengths of the baseline source-context model with our extended source-context and targetcontext model 
and we show 
that our extension allows us to better capture morphological coherence . <S>
