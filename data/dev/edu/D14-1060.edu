Term translation is of great importance for statistical machine translation ( SMT ) , especially document-informed SMT . <S>
In this paper , we investigate three issues of term translation in the context of document-informed SMT 
and propose three corresponding models : 
( a ) a term translation disambiguation model 
which selects desirable translations for terms in the source language with domain information , 
( b ) a term translation consistency model 
that encourages consistent translations for terms with a high strength of translation consistency throughout a document , 
and ( c ) a term bracketing model 
that rewards translation hypotheses 
where bracketable source terms are translated as a whole unit . <S>
We integrate the three models into hierarchical phrase-based SMT 
and evaluate their effectiveness on NIST Chinese-English translation tasks with large-scale training data . <S>
Experiment results show 
that all three models can achieve significant improvements over the baseline . <S>
Additionally , we can obtain a further improvement 
when combining the three models . <S>
