This study investigates on building a better Chinese word segmentation model for statistical machine translation . <S>
It aims at leveraging word boundary information , 
automatically learned by bilingual character-based alignments , 
to induce a preferable segmentation model . <S>
We propose dealing with the induced word boundaries as soft constraints 
to bias the continuous learning of a supervised CRFs model , 
trained by the treebank data ( labeled ) ,  on the bilingual data  ( unlabeled ) . <S>
The induced word boundary information is encoded as a graph propagation constraint . <S>
The constrained model induction is accomplished 
by using posterior regularization algorithm . <S>
The experiments on a Chinese-to-English machine translation task reveal 
that the proposed model can bring positive segmentation effects to translation quality . <S>
