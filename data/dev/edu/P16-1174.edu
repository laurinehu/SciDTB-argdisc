We present half-life regression ( HLR ) , a novel model for spaced repetition practice with applications to second language acquisition . <S>
HLR combines psycholinguistic theory with modern machine learning techniques , 
indirectly estimating the `` halflife '' of a word or concept in a student 's long-term memory . <S>
We use data from Duolingo - a popular online language learning application - 
to fit HLR models , 
reducing error by 45 % + 
compared to several baselines 
at predicting student recall rates . <S>
HLR model weights also shed light 
on which linguistic concepts are systematically challenging for second language learners . <S>
Finally , HLR was able to improve Duolingo daily student engagement by 12 % in an operational user study . <S>
