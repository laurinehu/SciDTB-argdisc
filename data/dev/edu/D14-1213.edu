Self-disclosure , the act of revealing one-self to others , is an important social behavior 
that strengthens interpersonal relationships 
and increases social support . <S>
Although there are many social science studies of self-disclosure , 
they are based on manual coding of small datasets and questionnaires . <S>
We conduct a computational analysis of self-disclosure with a large dataset of naturally-occurring conversations , a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm , and a computational analysis of the effects of self-disclosure on subsequent conversations . <S>
We use a longitudinal dataset of 17 million tweets , 
all of which occurred in conversations 
that consist of five or more tweets 
directly replying to the previous tweet , 
and from dyads with twenty of more conversations each . <S>
We develop self-disclosure topic model ( SDTM ) , a variant of latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) 
for automatically classifying the level of self-disclosure for each tweet . <S>
We take the results of SDTM 
and analyze the effects of self-disclosure on subsequent conversations . <S>
Our model significantly outperforms several comparable methods on classifying the level of self-disclosure , 
and the analysis of the longitudinal data 
using SDTM 
uncovers significant and positive correlation between self-disclosure and conversation frequency and length . <S>
