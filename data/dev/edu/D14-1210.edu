Data-driven refinement of non-terminal categories has been demonstrated to be a reliable technique 
for improving monolingual parsing with PCFGs . <S>
In this paper , we extend these techniques 
to learn latent refinements of single-category synchronous grammars , 
so as to improve translation performance . <S>
We compare two estimators for this latent-variable model : 
one based on EM and the other is a spectral algorithm 
based on the method of moments . <S>
We evaluate their performance on a Chinese-English translation task . <S>
The results indicate 
that we can achieve significant gains over the baseline with both approaches , 
but in particular the moments-based estimator is both faster 
and performs better than EM . <S>
