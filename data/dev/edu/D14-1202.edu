Correctly predicting abbreviations given the full forms 
is important in many natural language processing systems . <S>
In this paper we propose a two-stage method 
to find the corresponding abbreviation 
given its full form . <S>
We first use the contextual information 
given a large corpus 
to get abbreviation candidates for each full form 
and get a coarse-grained ranking through graph random walk . <S>
This coarse-grained rank list fixes the search space inside the top-ranked candidates . <S>
Then we use a similarity sensitive re-ranking strategy 
which can utilize the features of the candidates 
to give a fine-grained re-ranking 
and select the final result . <S>
Our method achieves good results 
and outperforms the state-of-the-art systems . <S>
One advantage of our method is that it only needs weak supervision 
and can get competitive results with fewer training data . <S>
The candidate generation and coarse-grained ranking is totally unsupervised . <S>
The re-ranking phase can use a very small amount of training data 
to get a reasonably good result . <S>
