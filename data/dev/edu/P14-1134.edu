Abstract Meaning Representation ( AMR ) is a semantic formalism 
for which a grow-ing set of annotated examples is available . <S>
We introduce the first approach 
to parse sentences into this representation , 
providing a strong baseline for future improvement . <S>
The method is based on a novel algorithm 
for finding a maximum spanning , connected subgraph , 
embedded within a Lagrangian relaxation of an optimization problem 
that imposes linguistically inspired constraints . <S>
Our approach is described in the general frame-work of structured prediction , 
allowing future incorporation of additional features and constraints , 
and may extend to other formalisms as well . <S>
Our open-source system , JAMR , is available at : http : //github.com/jflanigan/jamr <S>
