Linguistics studies have shown 
that action verbs often denote some Change of State ( CoS ) as the result of an action . <S>
However , the causality of action verbs and its potential connection with the physical world has not been systematically explored . <S>
To address this limitation , 
this paper presents a study on physical causality of action verbs and their implied changes in the physical world . <S>
We first conducted a crowdsourcing experiment 
and identified eighteen categories of physical causality for action verbs . <S>
For a subset of these categories , we then defined a set of detectors 
that detect the corresponding change from visual perception of the physical environment . <S>
We further incorporated physical causality modeling and state detection in grounded language understanding . <S>
Our empirical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of causality modeling in grounding language to perception . <S>
