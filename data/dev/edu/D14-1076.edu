In this paper , we focus on the problem 
of using sentence compression techniques to improve multi-document summarization . <S>
We propose an innovative sentence compression method 
by considering every node in the constituent parse tree 
and deciding its status 
- remove or retain . <S>
Integer liner programming with discriminative training is used 
to solve the problem . <S>
Under this model , we incorporate various constraints 
to improve the linguistic quality of the compressed sentences . <S>
Then we utilize a pipeline summarization framework 
where sentences are first compressed by our proposed compression model 
to obtain top-n candidates 
and then a sentence selection module is used 
to generate the final summary . <S>
Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms , 
our model has similar ROUGE-2 scores but better linguistic quality on TAC data . <S>
