We explore the impact of morphological segmentation on keyword spotting ( KWS ) . <S>
Despite potential benefits , 
state-of-the-art KWS systems do not use morphological information . <S>
In this paper , we augment a state-of-the-art KWS system with sub-word units 
derived from supervised and unsupervised morphological segmentations , 
and compare with phonetic and syllabic segmentations . <S>
Our experiments demonstrate 
that morphemes improve overall performance of KWS systems . <S>
Syllabic units , however , rival the performance of morphological units 
when used in KWS . <S>
By combining morphological , phonetic and syllabic segmentations , 
we demonstrate substantial performance gains . <S>
