Natural touch interfaces , common now in devices such as tablets and smartphones , make it cumbersome for users to select text . <S>
There is a need for a new text selection paradigm 
that goes beyond the high acuity selection-by-mouse 
that we have relied on for decades . <S>
In this paper , we introduce such a paradigm , 
called Smart Selection , 
which aims to recover a user's intended text selection from her touch input . <S>
We model the problem 
using an ensemble learning approach , 
which leverages multiple linguistic analysis techniques 
combined with information from a knowledge base and a Web graph . <S>
We collect a dataset of true intended user selections and simulated user touches 
via a large-scale crowdsourcing task , 
which we release to the academic community . <S>
We show 
that our model effectively addresses the smart selection task 
and significantly outperforms various baselines and standalone linguistic analysis techniques . <S>
