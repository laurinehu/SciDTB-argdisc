Quotation detection is the task 
of locating spans of quoted speech in text . <S>
The state of the art treats this problem as a sequence labeling task 
and employs linear-chain conditional random fields . <S>
We question the efficacy of this choice : 
The Markov assumption in the model prohibits it from making joint decisions about the begin , end , and internal context of a quotation . <S>
We perform an extensive analysis with two new model architectures . <S>
We find 
that ( a ) , simple boundary classification 
combined with a greedy prediction strategy 
is competitive with the state of the art ; 
( b ) , a semi-Markov model significantly outperforms all others , 
by relaxing the Markov assumption . <S>
