State-of-the-art fact extraction is heavily constrained by recall , 
as demonstrated by recent performance in TAC Slot Filling . <S>
We isolate this recall loss for NE slots 
by systematically analysing each stage of the slot filling pipeline as a filter over correct answers . <S>
Recall is critical 
as candidates never generated can never be recovered , 
whereas precision can always be increased in downstream processing . <S>
We provide precise , empirical confirmation of previously hypothesised sources of recall loss in slot filling . <S>
While NE type constraints substantially reduce the search space with only a minor recall penalty , 
we find 
that 10 % to 39 % of slot fills will be entirely ignored by most systems . <S>
One in six correct answers are lost 
if coreference is not used , 
but this can be mostly retained by simple name matching rules . <S>
