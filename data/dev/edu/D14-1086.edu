In this paper we introduce a new game 
to crowd-source natural language referring expressions . <S>
By designing a two player game , 
we can both collect and verify referring expressions directly within the game . <S>
To date , the game has produced a dataset 
containing 130,525 expressions , 
referring to 96,654 distinct objects , in 19,894 photographs of natural scenes . <S>
This dataset is larger and more varied than previous REG datasets 
and allows us to study referring expressions in real-world scenes . <S>
We provide an in depth analysis of the resulting dataset . <S>
Based on our findings , 
we design a new optimization based model 
for generating referring expressions 
and perform experimental evaluations on 3 test sets . <S>
