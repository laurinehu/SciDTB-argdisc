In this paper , we propose a joint model for unsupervised Chinese word segmentation ( CWS ) . <S>
Inspired by the "products of experts" idea , 
our joint model firstly combines two generative models , 
which are word-based hierarchical Dirichlet process model and character-based hidden Markov model , 
by simply multiplying their probabilities together . <S>
Gibbs sampling is used for model inference . <S>
In order to further combine the strength of goodness-based model , 
we then integrated nVBE into our joint model 
by using it to initializing the Gibbs sampler . <S>
We conduct our experiments on PKU and MSRA datasets 
provided by the second SIGHAN bakeoff . <S>
Test results on these two datasets show 
that the joint model achieves much better results than all of its component models . <S>
Statistical significance tests also show 
that it is significantly better than state-of-the-art systems , 
achieving the highest F-scores . <S>
Finally , analysis indicates 
that compared with nVBE and HDP , 
the joint model has a stronger ability 
to solve both combinational and overlapping ambiguities in Chinese word segmentation . <S>
