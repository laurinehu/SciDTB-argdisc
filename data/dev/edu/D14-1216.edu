We describe an algorithm for automatic classification of idiomatic and literal expressions . <S>
Our starting point is that words in a given text segment , such as a paragraph , 
that are high-ranking representatives of a common topic of discussion
are less likely to be a part of an idiomatic expression . <S>
Our additional hypothesis is that contexts 
in which idioms occur , typically , are more affective 
and therefore , we incorporate a simple analysis of the intensity of the emotions 
expressed by the contexts . <S>
We investigate the bag of words topic representation of one to three paragraphs 
containing an expression 
that should be classified as idiomatic or literal 
( a target phrase ) . <S>
We extract topics from paragraphs 
containing idioms and from paragraphs 
containing literals 
using an unsupervised clustering method , Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) ( Blei et al. , 2003 ) . <S>
Since idiomatic expressions exhibit the property of non-compositionality , 
we assume 
that they usually present different semantics than the words 
used in the local topic . <S>
We treat idioms as semantic outliers , and the identification of a semantic shift as outlier detection . <S>
Thus , this topic representation allows us to differentiate idioms from literals 
using local semantic contexts . <S>
Our results are encouraging . <S>
