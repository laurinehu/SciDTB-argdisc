Advances in transfer learning have let go the limitations of traditional supervised machine learning algorithms 
for being dependent on annotated training data 
for training new models for every new domain . <S>
However , several applications encounter scenarios 
where models need to transfer/adapt across domains 
when the label sets vary both in terms of count of labels as well as their connotations . <S>
This paper presents first-of-its-kind transfer learning algorithm for cross-domain classification with multiple source domains and disparate label sets . <S>
It starts with identifying transferable knowledge from across multiple domains 
that can be useful for learning the target domain task . <S>
This knowledge in the form of selective labeled instances from different domains is congregated 
to form an auxiliary training set 
which is used for learning the target domain task . <S>
Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm against strong baselines on a real world social media and the 20 Newsgroups datasets . <S>
