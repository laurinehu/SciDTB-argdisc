Distributional semantics creates vectorspace representations 
that capture many forms of semantic similarity , 
but their relation to semantic entailment has been less clear . <S>
We propose a vector-space model 
which provides a formal foundation for a distributional semantics of entailment . <S>
Using a mean-field approximation , 
we develop approximate inference procedures and entailment operators over vectors of probabilities of features 
being known ( versus unknown ) . <S>
We use this framework 
to reinterpret an existing distributionalsemantic model ( Word2Vec ) 
as approximating an entailment-based model of the distributions of words in contexts , 
thereby predicting lexical entailment relations . <S>
In both unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on hyponymy detection , we get substantial improvements over previous results . <S>
