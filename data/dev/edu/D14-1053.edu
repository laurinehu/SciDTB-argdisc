We propose a semi-supervised bootstrapping algorithm 
for analyzing China's foreign relations from the People's Daily . <S>
Our approach addresses sentiment target clustering , subjective lexicons extraction and sentiment prediction in a unified framework . <S>
Different from existing algorithms in the literature , 
time information is considered in our algorithm through a hierarchical bayesian model 
to guide the bootstrapping approach . <S>
We are hopeful that our approach can facilitate quantitative political analysis 
conducted by social scientists and politicians . <S>
