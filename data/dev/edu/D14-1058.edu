This paper presents a novel approach 
to learning to solve simple arithmetic word problems . <S>
Our system , ARIS , analyzes each of the sentences in the problem state-ment 
to identify the relevant variables and their values . <S>
ARIS then maps this information into an equation 
that represents the problem , 
and enables its ( trivial ) solution 
as shown in Figure 1 . <S>
The paper analyzes the arithmetic-word problems "genre" , 
identifying seven categories of verbs 
used in such problems . <S>
ARIS learns to categorize verbs with 81.2 % accuracy , 
and is able to solve 77.7 % of the problems in a corpus of standard primary school test questions . <S>
We report the first learning results on this task 
without reliance on pre-defined templates 
and make our data publicly available . <S>
