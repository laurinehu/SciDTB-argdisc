In Corpus-Based Machine Translation , the search space of the translation candidates for a given input sentence is often defined by a set of ( cycle-free ) context-free grammar rules . <S>
This happens naturally in Syntax-Based Machine Translation and Hierarchical Phrase-Based Machine Translation 
( where the representation will be the set of the target-side half of the synchronous rules 
used to parse the input sentence ) . <S>
But it is also possible to describe Phrase-Based Machine Translation in this framework . <S>
We propose a natural extension to this representation 
by using lattice-rules 
that allow to easily encode an exponential number of variations of each rules . <S>
We also demonstrate 
how the representation of the search space has an impact on decoding efficiency , 
and how it is possible to optimize this representation . <S>
