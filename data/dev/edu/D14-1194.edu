We describe a convolutional neural network 
that learns feature representations for short textual posts 
using hashtags as a supervised signal. <S>
The proposed approach is trained on up to 5.5 billion words 
predicting 100,000 possible hashtags . <S>
As well as strong performance on the hashtag prediction task itself , 
we show 
that its learned representation of text 
( ignoring the hashtag labels ) 
is useful for other tasks as well . <S>
To that end , we present results on a document recommendation task , 
where it also outperforms a number of baselines . <S>
