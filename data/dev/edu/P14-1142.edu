It is very important for Chinese language processing with the aid of an efficient input method engine ( IME ) , 
of which pinyin-to-Chinese ( PTC ) conversion is the core part . <S>
Meanwhile , though typos are inevitable 
during user pinyin inputting , 
existing IMEs paid little attention to such big inconvenience . <S>
In this paper , motivated by a key equivalence of two decoding algorithms , 
we propose a joint graph model 
to globally optimize PTC and typo correction for IME . <S>
The evaluation results show 
that the proposed method outperforms both existing academic and commercial IMEs . <S>
