Accurate scoring of syntactic structures such as head-modifier arcs in dependency parsing typically requires rich , high-dimensional feature representations . <S>
A small subset of such features is often selected manually . <S>
This is problematic 
when features lack clear linguistic meaning as in embeddings 
or when the information is blended across features . <S>
In this paper , we use tensors 
to map high-dimensional feature vectors into low dimensional representations . <S>
We explicitly maintain the parameters as a low-rank tensor 
to obtain low dimensional representations of words in their syntactic roles , 
and to leverage modularity in the tensor for easy training with online algorithms . <S>
Our parser consistently outperforms the Turbo and MST parsers across 14 different languages . <S>
We also obtain the best published UAS results on 5 languages . <S>
