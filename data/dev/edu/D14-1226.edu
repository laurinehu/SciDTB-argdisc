A typical discussion thread in an online forum spans multiple pages 
involving participation from multiple users 
and thus , may contain multiple view-points and solutions . <S>
A user 
interested in the topic of discussion 
or having a problem similar to being discussed in the thread 
may not want to read all the previous posts but only a few selected posts 
that provide her a concise summary of the ongoing discussion . <S>
This paper describes an extractive summarization technique 
that uses textual features and dialog act information of individual messages 
to select a subset of posts . <S>
Proposed approach is evaluated 
using two real life forum datasets . <S>
