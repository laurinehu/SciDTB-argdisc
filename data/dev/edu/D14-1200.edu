This paper proposes a history-based structured learning approach 
that jointly extracts entities and relations in a sentence . <S>
We introduce a novel simple and flexible table representation of entities and relations . <S>
We investigate several feature settings , search orders , and learning methods with inexact search on the table . <S>
The experimental results demonstrate 
that a joint learning approach significantly outperforms a pipeline approach 
by incorporating global features 
and by selecting appropriate learning methods and search orders . <S>
