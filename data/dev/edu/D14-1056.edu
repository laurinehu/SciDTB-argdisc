Shell nouns , such as fact and problem , occur frequently in all kinds of texts . <S>
These nouns themselves are unspecific , 
and can only be interpreted together with the shell content . <S>
We propose a general approach 
to automatically identify shell content of shell nouns . <S>
Our approach exploits lexico-syntactic knowledge 
derived from the linguistics literature . <S>
We evaluate the approach on a variety of shell nouns with a variety of syntactic expectations , 
achieving accuracies in the range of 62 % ( baseline = 33 % ) to 83 % ( baseline = 74 % ) on crowd-annotated data . <S>
