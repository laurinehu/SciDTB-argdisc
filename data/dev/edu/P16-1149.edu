State legislatures often rely on existing text 
when drafting new bills . <S>
Resource and expertise constraints , 
which often drive this copying behavior , 
can be taken advantage of by lobbyists and special interest groups . <S>
These groups provide model bills , 
which encode policy agendas , with the intent 
that the models become actual law . <S>
Unfortunately , model legislation is often opaque to the public-both in source and content . <S>
In this paper we present LOBBYBACK , a system 
that reverse engineers model legislation from observed text . <S>
LOBBYBACK identifies clusters of bills 
which have text reuse 
and generates `` prototypes '' 
that represent a canonical version of the text 
shared between the documents . <S>
We demonstrate 
that LOBBYBACK accurately reconstructs model legislation 
and apply it to a dataset of over 550k bills . <S>
