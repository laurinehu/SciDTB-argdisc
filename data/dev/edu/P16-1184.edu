Morphologically rich languages often lack the annotated linguistic resources 
required to develop accurate natural language processing tools . <S>
We propose models 
suitable for training morphological taggers with rich tagsets for low-resource languages 
without using direct supervision . <S>
Our approach extends existing approaches 
of projecting part-of-speech tags across languages , 
using bitext to infer constraints on the possible tags for a given word type or token . <S>
We propose a tagging model 
using Wsabie , a discriminative embeddingbased model with rank-based learning . <S>
In our evaluation on 11 languages , on average this model performs on par with a baseline weakly-supervised HMM , 
while being more scalable . <S>
Multilingual experiments show 
that the method performs best 
when projecting between related language pairs . <S>
Despite the inherently lossy projection , 
we show 
that the morphological tags 
predicted by our models 
improve the downstream performance of a parser by +0.6 LAS on average . <S>
