Text-level discourse parsing remains a challenge : 
most approaches employ features 
that fail to capture the intentional , semantic , and syntactic aspects 
that govern discourse coherence . <S>
In this paper , we propose a recursive model for discourse parsing 
that jointly models distributed representations for clauses , sentences , and entire discourses . <S>
The learned representations can to some extent learn the semantic and intentional import of words and larger discourse units automatically , . <S>
The proposed framework obtains comparable performance 
regarding standard discours-ing parsing evaluations 
when compared against current state-of-art systems . <S>
