Various studies highlighted 
that topic-based approaches give a powerful spoken content representation of documents . <S>
Nonetheless , these documents may contain more than one main theme , 
and their automatic transcription inevitably contains errors . <S>
In this study , we propose an original and promising framework 
based on a compact representation of a textual document , 
to solve issues 
related to topic space granularity . <S>
Firstly , various topic spaces are estimated with different numbers of classes from a Latent Dirichlet Allocation . <S>
Then , this multiple topic space representation is compacted into an elementary segment , 
called c-vector , 
originally developed in the context of speaker recognition . <S>
Experiments are conducted on the DECODA corpus of conversations . <S>
Results show the effectiveness of the proposed multi-view compact representation paradigm . <S>
Our identification system reaches an accuracy of 85 % , with a significant gain of 9 points 
compared to the baseline 
( best single topic space configuration ) . <S>
