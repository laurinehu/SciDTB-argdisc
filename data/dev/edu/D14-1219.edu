In this paper , we present a discriminative approach 
for reranking discourse trees 
generated by an existing probabilistic discourse parser . <S>
The reranker relies on tree kernels ( TKs ) 
to capture the global dependencies between discourse units in a tree . <S>
In particular , we design new computational structures of discourse trees , 
which combined with standard TKs , 
originate novel discourse TKs . <S>
The empirical evaluation shows 
that our reranker can improve the state-of-the-art sentence-level parsing accuracy from 79.77 % to 82.15 % , a relative error reduction of 11.8 % , 
which in turn pushes the state-of-the-art document-level accuracy from 55.8 % to 57.3 % . <S>
