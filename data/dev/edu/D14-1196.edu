The current state-of-the-art single-document summarization method generates a summary 
by solving a Tree Knapsack Problem ( TKP ) , 
which is the problem of finding the optimal rooted subtree of the dependency-based discourse tree ( DEP-DT ) of a document . <S>
We can obtain a gold DEP-DT 
by transforming a gold Rhetorical Structure Theory-based discourse tree ( RST-DT ) . <S>
However , there is still a large difference between the ROUGE scores of a system with a gold DEP-DT and a system with a DEP-DT 
obtained from an automatically parsed RST-DT . <S>
To improve the ROUGE score , 
we propose a novel discourse parser 
that directly generates the DEP-DT . <S>
The evaluation results showed 
that the TKP with our parser outperformed that with the state-of-the-art RST-DT parser , 
and achieved almost equivalent ROUGE scores to the TKP with the gold DEP-DT . <S>
