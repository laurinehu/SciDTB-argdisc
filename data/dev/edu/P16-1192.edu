Parsing for a wide variety of grammar formalisms can be performed 
by intersecting finite tree automata . <S>
However , naive implementations of parsing by intersection are very inefficient . <S>
We present techniques 
that speed up tree-automata-based parsing , to the point 
that it becomes practically feasible on realistic data 
when applied to context-free , TAG , and graph parsing . <S>
For graph parsing , we obtain the best runtimes in the literature . <S>
