Finding paraphrases in text is an important task with implications for generation , summarization and question answering , among other applications . <S>
Of particular interest to those applications is the specific formulation of the task 
where the paraphrases are templated , 
which provides an easy way 
to lexicalize one message in multiple ways 
by simply plugging in the relevant entities . <S>
Previous work has focused on mining paraphrases from parallel and comparable corpora , 
or mining very short sub-sentence synonyms and paraphrases . <S>
In this paper we present an approach 
which combines distributional and KB-driven methods 
to allow robust mining of sentence-level paraphrasal templates , 
utilizing a rich type system for the slots , from a plain text corpus . <S>
