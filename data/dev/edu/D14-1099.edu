The introduction of dynamic oracles has considerably improved the accuracy of greedy transition-based dependency parsers , 
without sacrificing parsing efficiency . <S>
However , this enhancement is limited to projective parsing , 
and dynamic oracles have not yet been implemented for parsers 
supporting non-projectivity . <S>
In this paper we introduce the first such oracle , for a non-projective parser 
based on Attardi's parser . <S>
We show 
that training with this oracle improves parsing accuracy over a conventional ( static ) oracle on a wide range of datasets . <S>
