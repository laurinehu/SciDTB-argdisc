Distributional semantic models ( DSMs ) are often evaluated on artificial similarity datasets 
containing single words or fully compositional phrases . <S>
We present a large-scale multilingual evaluation of DSMs 
for predicting the degree of semantic compositionality of nominal compounds on 4 datasets for English and French . <S>
We build a total of 816 DSMs 
and perform 2,856 evaluations 
using word2vec , GloVe , and PPMI-based models . <S>
In addition to the DSMs , we compare the impact of different parameters , 
such as level of corpus preprocessing , context window size and number of dimensions . <S>
The results obtained have a high correlation with human judgments , 
being comparable to or outperforming the state of the art for some datasets ( Spearman 's p=.82 for the Reddy dataset ) . <S>
