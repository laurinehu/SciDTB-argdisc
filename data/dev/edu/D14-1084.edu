State-of-the-art Chinese zero pronoun resolution systems are supervised , 
thus relying on training data 
containing manually resolved zero pronouns . <S>
To eliminate the reliance on annotated data , 
we present a generative model for unsupervised Chinese zero pronoun resolution . <S>
At the core of our model is a novel hypothesis : 
a probabilistic pronoun resolver 
trained on overt pronouns in an unsupervised manner 
can be used 
to resolve zero pronouns . <S>
Experiments demonstrate 
that our unsupervised model rivals its state-of-the-art supervised counterparts in performance 
when resolving the Chinese zero pronouns in the OntoNotes corpus . <S>
