Parameter tuning is an important problem in statistical machine translation , 
but surprisingly , most existing methods such as MERT , MIRA and PRO are agnostic about search , 
while search errors could severely degrade translation quality . <S>
We propose a search-aware framework 
to promote promising partial translations , 
preventing them from be-ing pruned . <S>
To do so 
we develop two metrics to evaluate partial derivations . <S>
Our technique can be applied to all of the three above-mentioned tuning methods , 
and extensive experiments on Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation show up to +2.6 BLEU gains over search-agnostic baselines . <S>
