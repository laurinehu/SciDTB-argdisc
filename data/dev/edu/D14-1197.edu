We show 
that semantic relationships can be used 
to improve word alignment , in addition to the lexical and syntactic features 
that are typically used . <S>
In this paper , we present a method 
based on a neural network 
to automatically derive word similarity from monolingual data . <S>
We present an extension 
to word alignment models 
that exploits word similarity . <S>
Our experiments , in both large-scale and resource-limited settings , show improvements in word alignment tasks as well as translation tasks . <S>
