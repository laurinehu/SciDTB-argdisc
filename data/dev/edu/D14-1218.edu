Coherence is what makes a multi-sentence text meaningful , both logically and syntactically . <S>
To solve the challenge of ordering a set of sentences into coherent order , 
existing approaches focus mostly on defining and using sophisticated features 
to capture the cross-sentence argumentation logic and syntactic relationships . <S>
But both argumentation semantics and cross-sentence syntax 
( such as coreference and tense rules ) 
are very hard 
to formalize . <S>
In this paper , we introduce a neural network model for the coherence task 
based on distributed sentence representation . <S>
The proposed approach learns a syntactico-semantic representation for sentences automatically , 
using either recurrent or recursive neural networks . <S>
The architecture obviated the need for feature engineering , 
and learns sentence representations , 
which are to some extent able to capture the "rules" 
governing coherent sentence structure . <S>
The proposed approach outperforms existing baselines 
and generates the state-of-art performance in standard coherence evaluation tasks . <S>
