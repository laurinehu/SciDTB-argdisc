The sense 
in which a word is used 
determines the translation of the word . <S>
In this paper , we propose a sense-based translation model 
to integrate word senses into statistical machine translation . <S>
We build a broad-coverage sense tagger 
based on a nonparametric Bayesian topic model 
that automatically learns sense clusters for words in the source language . <S>
The proposed sense-based translation model enables the decoder to select appropriate translations for source words 
according to the inferred senses for these words 
using maximum entropy classifiers . <S>
Our method is significantly different from previous word sense disambiguation 
reformulated for machine translation 
in that the latter neglects word senses in nature . <S>
We test the effectiveness of the proposed sense-based translation model on a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task . <S>
Results show 
that the proposed model substantially outperforms not only the baseline but also the previous reformulated word sense disambiguation . <S>
