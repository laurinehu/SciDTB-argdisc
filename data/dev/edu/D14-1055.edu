Deceptive reviews detection has attracted significant attention from both business and research communities . <S>
However , due to the difficulty of human labeling 
needed for supervised learning , 
the problem remains to be highly challenging . <S>
This paper proposed a novel angle to the problem 
by modeling PU ( positive unlabeled ) learning . <S>
A semi-supervised model , 
called mixing population 
and individual property PU learning ( MPIPUL ) , is proposed . <S>
Firstly , some reliable negative examples are identified from the unlabeled dataset . <S>
Secondly , some representative positive examples and negative examples are generated
based on LDA ( Latent Dirichlet Allocation ) . <S>
Thirdly , for the remaining unlabeled examples 
( we call them spy examples ) , 
which can not be explicitly identified as positive and negative , 
two similarity weights are assigned , 
by which the probability of a spy example 
belonging to the positive class and the negative class 
are displayed . <S>
Finally , spy examples and their similarity weights are incorporated into SVM ( Support Vector Machine ) 
to build an accurate classifier . <S>
Experiments on gold-standard dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MPIPUL 
which outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines . <S>
