Temporal scope adds a time dimension to facts in Knowledge Bases ( KBs ) . <S>
These time scopes specify the time periods 
when a given fact was valid in real life . <S>
Without temporal scope , 
many facts are under-specified , 
reducing the usefulness of the data for upper level applications such as Question Answering . <S>
Existing methods for temporal scope inference and extraction still suffer from low accuracy . <S>
In this paper , we present a new method 
that leverages temporal profiles augmented with contextâ€” Contextual Temporal Profiles ( CTPs ) of entities . <S>
Through change patterns in an entity's CTP , 
we model the entity's state change 
brought about by real world events 
that happen to the entity 
( e.g , hired , fired , divorced , etc. ) . <S>
This leads to a new formulation of the temporal scoping problem as a state change detection problem . <S>
Our experiments show 
that this formulation of the problem , and the resulting solution are highly effective 
for inferring temporal scope of facts . <S>
