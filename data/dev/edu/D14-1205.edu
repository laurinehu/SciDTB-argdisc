Populating Knowledge Base ( KB ) with new knowledge facts from reliable text re-sources usually consists of linking name mentions to KB entities and identifying relationship between entity pairs . <S>
However , the task often suffers from errors 
propagating from upstream entity linkers to downstream relation extractors . <S>
In this paper , we propose a novel joint inference framework 
to allow interactions between the two subtasks 
and find an optimal assignment 
by addressing the coherence among preliminary local predictions : 
whether the types of entities meet the expectations of relations explicitly or implicitly , 
and whether the local predictions are globally compatible . <S>
We further measure the confidence of the extracted triples 
by looking at the details of the complete extraction process . <S>
Experiments show 
that the proposed framework can significantly reduce the error propagations 
thus obtain more reliable facts , 
and outperforms competitive baselines with state-of-the-art relation extraction models . <S>
