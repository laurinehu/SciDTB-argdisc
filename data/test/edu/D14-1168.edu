We propose a novel abstractive summarization system for product reviews
by taking advantage of their discourse structure . <S>
First , we apply a discourse parser to each review 
and obtain a discourse tree representation for every review . <S>
We then modify the discourse trees 
such that every leaf node only contains the aspect words . <S>
Second , we aggregate the aspect discourse trees 
and generate a graph . <S>
We then select a subgraph 
representing the most important aspects and the rhetorical relations between them 
using a PageRank algorithm , 
and transform the selected subgraph into an aspect tree . <S>
Finally , we generate a natural language summary 
by applying a template-based NLG framework . <S>
Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results , based on two user studies , 
show 
that our approach significantly outperforms extractive and abstractive baselines . <S>
