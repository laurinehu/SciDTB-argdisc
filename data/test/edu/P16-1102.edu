Automatic spoken language assessment systems are becoming increasingly important 
to meet the demand for English second language learning . <S>
This is a challenging task 
due to the high error rates of , even state-of-the-art , non-native speech recognition . <S>
Consequently current systems primarily assess fluency and pronunciation . <S>
However , content assessment is essential for full automation . <S>
As a first stage it is important to judge 
whether the speaker responds on topic 
to test questions 
designed to elicit spontaneous speech . <S>
Standard approaches to off-topic response detection assess similarity between the response and question 
based on bag-of-words representations . <S>
An alternative framework 
based on Recurrent Neural Network Language Models ( RNNLM ) 
is proposed in this paper . <S>
The RNNLM is adapted to the topic of each test question . <S>
It learns to associate example responses to questions with points in a topic space 
constructed using these example responses . <S>
Classification is done 
by ranking the topic-conditional posterior probabilities of a response . <S>
The RNNLMs associate a broad range of responses with each topic , 
incorporate sequence information and scale better with additional training data , unlike standard methods . <S>
On experiments 
conducted on data from the Business Language Testing Service ( BULATS ) 
this approach outperforms standard approaches . <S>
