We present a new lexical resource for the study of preposition behavior , the Pattern Dictionary of English Prepositions ( PDEP ) . <S>
This dictionary , 
which follows principles 
laid out in Hanks' theory of norms and exploitations , 
is linked to 81,509 sentences for 304 prepositions , 
which have been made available under The Preposition Project ( TPP ) . <S>
Notably , 47,285 sentences , 
initially untagged , 
provide a representative sample of preposition use , 
unlike the tagged sentences 
used in previous studies . <S>
Each sentence has been parsed with a dependency parser 
and our system has near-instantaneous access to features 
developed with this parser 
to explore and annotate properties of individual senses . <S>
The features make extensive use of WordNet . <S>
We have extended feature exploration 
to include lookup of FrameNet lexical units and VerbNet classes for use 
in characterizing preposition behavior . <S>
We have designed our system 
to allow public access to any of the data available in the system . <S>
