Child semantic development includes learning the meaning of words as well as the semantic relations among words . <S>
A presumed outcome of semantic development is the formation of a semantic network 
that reflects this knowledge . <S>
We present an algorithm for simultaneously learning word meanings 
and gradually growing a semantic network , 
which adheres to the cognitive plausibility requirements of incrementality and limited computations . <S>
We demonstrate 
that the semantic connections among words in addition to their context is necessary in forming a semantic network 
that resembles an adult's semantic knowledge . <S>
