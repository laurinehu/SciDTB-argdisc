We present a new proof 
that O2 is a multiple context-free language . <S>
It contrasts with a recent proof by Salvati ( 2015 ) in its avoidance of concepts 
that seem specific to two-dimensional geometry , 
such as the complex exponential function . <S>
Our simple proof creates realistic prospects 
of widening the results to higher dimensions . <S>
This finding is of central importance to the relation between extreme free word order and classes of grammars 
used to describe the syntax of natural language . <S>
