This paper presents a novel approach 
to improve reordering in phrase-based machine translation 
by using richer , syntactic representations of units of bilingual language models ( BiLMs ) . <S>
Our method 
to include syntactic information 
is simple in implementation 
and requires minimal changes in the decoding algorithm . <S>
The approach is evaluated in a series of Arabic-English and Chinese-English translation experiments . <S>
The best models demonstrate significant improvements in BLEU and TER over the phrase-based baseline , as well as over the lexicalized BiLM by Niehues et al. ( 2011 ) . <S>
Further improvements of up to 0.45 BLEU for Arabic-English and up to 0.59 BLEU for Chinese-English are obtained 
by combining our dependency BiLM with a lexicalized BiLM . <S>
An improvement of 0.98 BLEU is obtained for Chinese-English in the setting of an increased distortion limit . <S>
