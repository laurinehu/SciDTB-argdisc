Intelligent assistants on mobile devices , 
such as Siri , 
have recently gained considerable attention as novel applications of dialogue technologies . <S>
A tremendous amount of real users of intelligent assistants provide us with an opportunity 
to explore a novel task 
of predicting whether users will continually use their intelligent assistants in the future . <S>
We developed prediction models of prospective user engagement 
by using large-scale user logs 
obtained from a commercial intelligent assistant . <S>
Experiments demonstrated 
that our models can predict prospective user engagement reasonably well , 
and outperforms a strong baseline 
that makes prediction based past utterance frequency <S>
