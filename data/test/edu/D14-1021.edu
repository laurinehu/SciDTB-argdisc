We study a novel architecture for syntactic SMT . <S>
In contrast to the dominant approach in the literature , 
the system does not rely on translation rules , 
but treat translation as an unconstrained target sentence generation task , 
using soft features 
to capture lexical and syntactic correspondences between the source and target languages . <S>
Target syntax features and bilingual translation features are trained consistently in a discriminative model . <S>
Experiments using the IWSLT 2010 dataset 
show 
that the system achieves BLEU comparable to the state-of-the-art syntactic SMT systems . <S>
