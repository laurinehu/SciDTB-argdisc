Effective text classification requires experts to annotate data with labels ; 
these training data are time-consuming and expensive to obtain . <S>
If you know what labels you want , 
active learning can reduce the number of labeled documents needed . <S>
However , establishing the label set remains difficult . <S>
Annotators often lack the global knowledge 
needed to induce a label set . <S>
We introduce ALTO : Active Learning with Topic Overviews , an interactive system 
to help humans annotate documents : 
topic models provide a global overview 
of what labels to create 
and active learning directs them to the right documents 
to label . <S>
Our forty-annotator user study shows 
that while active learning alone is best in extremely resource limited conditions , 
topic models ( even by themselves ) lead to better label sets , 
and ALTO 's combination is best overall . <S>
