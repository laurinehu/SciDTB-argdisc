Probabilistic Soft Logic ( PSL ) is a recently developed framework for probabilistic logic . <S>
We use PSL to combine logical and distributional representations of natural-language meaning , 
where distributional information is represented in the form of weighted inference rules . <S>
We apply this framework to the task of Semantic Textual Similarity ( STS ) 
( i.e. judging the semantic similarity of natural-language sentences ) , 
and show 
that PSL gives improved results 
compared to a previous approach 
based on Markov Logic Networks ( MLNs ) 
and a purely distributional approach . <S>
