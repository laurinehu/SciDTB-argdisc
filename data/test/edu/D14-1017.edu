Generative word alignment models , such as IBM Models , are restricted to one-to-many alignment , 
and cannot explicitly represent many-to-many relationships in a bilingual text . <S>
The problem is partially solved 
either by introducing heuristics or by agreement constraints 
such that two directional word alignments agree with each other . <S>
In this paper , we focus on the posterior regularization frame-work ( Ganchev et al. , 2010 ) 
that can force two directional word alignment models to agree with each other 
during training , 
and propose new constraints 
that can take into account the difference between function words and content words . <S>
Experimental results on French-to-English and Japanese-to-English alignment tasks show statistically significant gains over the previous posterior regularization baseline . <S>
We also observed gains in Japanese-to-English translation tasks , 
which prove the effectiveness of our methods under grammatically different language pairs . <S>
