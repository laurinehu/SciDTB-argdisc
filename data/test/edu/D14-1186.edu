Previous work often used a pipelined framework 
where Chinese word segmentation is followed by term extraction and keyword extraction . <S>
Such framework suffers from error propagation 
and is unable to leverage information in later modules for prior components . <S>
In this paper , we propose a four-level Dirichlet Process based model ( DP-4 ) 
to jointly learn the word distributions from the corpus , domain and document levels simultaneously . <S>
Based on the DP-4 model , 
a sentence-wise Gibbs sampler is adopted 
to obtain proper segmentation results . <S>
Meanwhile , terms and keywords are acquired in the sampling process . <S>
Experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our method . <S>
