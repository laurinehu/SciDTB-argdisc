We investigate 
how to improve bilingual embedding 
which has been successfully used as a feature in phrase-based statistical machine translation ( SMT ) . <S>
Despite bilingual embedding's success , 
the contextual information , 
which is of critical importance to translation quality , 
was ignored in previous work . <S>
To employ the contextual information , 
we propose a simple and memory-efficient model 
for learning bilingual embedding , 
taking both the source phrase and context around the phrase into account . <S>
Bilingual translation scores 
generated from our proposed bilingual embedding model 
are used as features in our SMT system . <S>
Experimental results show 
that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on large-scale Chinese-English translation task . <S>
