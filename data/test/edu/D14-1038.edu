Search engines are increasingly relying on large knowledge bases of facts 
to provide direct answers to users' queries . <S>
However , the construction of these knowledge bases is largely manual 
and does not scale to the long and heavy tail of facts . <S>
Open information extraction tries to address this challenge , 
but typically assumes 
that facts are expressed with verb phrases , 
and therefore has had difficulty 
extracting facts for noun-based relations . <S>
We describe ReNoun , an open information extraction system 
that complements previous efforts
by focusing on nominal attributes and on the long tail . <S>
ReNoun's approach is based on leveraging a large ontology of noun attributes 
mined from a text corpus and from user queries . <S>
ReNoun creates a seed set of training data 
by using specialized patterns 
and requiring 
that the facts mention an attribute in the ontology . <S>
ReNoun then generalizes from this seed set 
to produce a much larger set of extractions 
that are then scored . <S>
We describe experiments 
that show 
that we extract facts with high precision and for attributes 
that cannot be extracted with verb-based techniques . <S>
