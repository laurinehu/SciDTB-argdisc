We report on a series of experiments with convolutional neural networks ( CNN ) 
trained on top of pre-trained word vectors for sentence-level classification tasks . <S>
We show 
that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static vectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks . <S>
Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance . <S>
We additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture 
to allow for the use of both task-specific and static vectors . <S>
The CNN models discussed herein improve upon the state of the art on 4 out of 7 tasks , 
which include sentiment analysis and question classification . <S>
