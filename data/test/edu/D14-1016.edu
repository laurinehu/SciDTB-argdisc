We present a novel approach 
to improve word alignment for statistical machine translation ( SMT ) . <S>
Conventional word alignment methods allow discontinuous alignment , 
meaning 
that a source ( or target ) word links to several target ( or source ) words 
whose positions are discontinuous . <S>
However , we cannot extract phrase pairs from this kind of alignments 
as they break the alignment consistency constraint . <S>
In this paper , we use a weighted vote method 
to transform discontinuous word alignment to continuous alignment , 
which enables SMT systems extract more phrase pairs . <S>
We carry out experiments on large scale Chinese-to-English and German-to-English translation tasks . <S>
Experimental results show 
statistically significant improvements of BLEU score in both cases over the baseline systems . <S>
Our method produces a gain of +1.68 BLEU on NIST OpenMT04 for the phrase-based system , and a gain of +1.28 BLEU on NIST OpenMT06 for the hierarchical phrase-based system . <S>
