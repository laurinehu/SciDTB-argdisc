Translating into morphologically rich languages is a particularly difficult problem in machine translation 
due to the high degree of inflectional ambiguity in the target language , 
often only poorly captured by existing word translation models . <S>
We present a general approach 
that exploits source-side contexts of foreign words 
to improve translation prediction accuracy . <S>
Our approach is based on a probabilistic neural network 
which does not require linguistic annotation nor manual feature engineering . <S>
We report significant improvements in word translation prediction accuracy for three morphologically rich target languages . <S>
In addition , preliminary results for integrating our approach into a large-scale English-Russian statistical machine translation system show small but statistically significant improvements in translation quality . <S>
