This paper complements semantic role representations with spatial knowledge 
beyond indicating plain locations . <S>
Namely , we extract where entities are ( and are not ) located , 
and for how long ( seconds , hours , days , etc. ) . <S>
Crowdsourced annotations show 
that this additional knowledge is intuitive to humans 
and can be annotated by non-experts . <S>
Experimental results show 
that the task can be automated . <S>
