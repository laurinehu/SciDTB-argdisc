This paper presents a deep semantic similarity model ( DSSM ) , a special type of deep neural networks 
designed for text analysis , 
for recommending target documents 
to be of interest to a user 
based on a source document 
that she is reading . <S>
We observe , identify , and detect naturally occurring signals of interestingness in click transitions on the Web between source and target documents , 
which we collect from commercial Web browser logs . <S>
The DSSM is trained on millions of Web transitions , 
and maps source-target document pairs to feature vectors in a latent space in such a way 
that the distance between source documents and their corresponding interesting targets in that space is minimized . <S>
The effectiveness of the DSSM is demonstrated 
using two interestingness tasks : 
automatic highlighting and contextual entity search . <S>
The results on large-scale , real-world datasets show 
that the semantics of documents are important for modeling interestingness 
and that the DSSM leads to significant quality improvement on both tasks , 
outperforming not only the classic document models 
that do not use semantics 
but also state-of-the-art topic models . <S>
