Large-scale knowledge bases are important assets in NLP . <S>
Frequently , such resources are constructed 
through automatic mergers of complementary resources , 
such as WordNet and Wikipedia . <S>
However , manually validating these resources is prohibitively expensive , 
even when using methods such as crowdsourcing . <S>
We propose a cost-effective method 
of validating and extending knowledge bases 
using video games with a purpose . <S>
Two video games were created 
to validate concept-concept and concept-image relations . <S>
In experiments 
comparing with crowdsourcing , 
we show 
that video game-based validation consistently leads to higher-quality annotations , 
even when players are not compensated . <S>
