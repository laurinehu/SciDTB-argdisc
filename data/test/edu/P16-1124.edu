Knowledge bases ( KBs ) are often greatly incomplete , 
necessitating a demand for KB completion . <S>
The path ranking algorithm ( PRA ) is one of the most promising approaches to this task . <S>
Previous work on PRA usually follows a single-task learning paradigm , 
building a prediction model for each relation independently with its own training data . <S>
It ignores meaningful associations among certain relations , 
and might not get enough training data for less frequent relations . <S>
This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning framework for PRA , 
referred to as coupled PRA ( CPRA ) . <S>
It first devises an agglomerative clustering strategy 
to automatically discover relations 
that are highly correlated to each other , 
and then employs a multi-task learning strategy 
to effectively couple the prediction of such relations . <S>
As such , CPRA takes into account relation association 
and enables implicit data sharing among them . <S>
We empirically evaluate CPRA on benchmark data 
created from Freebase . <S>
Experimental results show 
that CPRA can effectively identify coherent clusters 
in which relations are highly correlated . <S>
By further coupling such relations , 
CPRA significantly outperforms PRA , in terms of both predictive accuracy and model interpretability . <S>
