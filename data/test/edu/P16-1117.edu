This paper presents a novel model for Japanese predicate argument structure ( PAS ) analysis 
based on a neural network framework . <S>
Japanese PAS analysis is challenging 
due to the tangled characteristics of the Japanese language , 
such as case disappearance and argument omission . <S>
To unravel this problem , 
we learn selectional preferences from a large raw corpus , 
and incorporate them into a SOTA PAS analysis model , 
which considers the consistency of all PASs in a given sentence . <S>
We demonstrate 
that the proposed PAS analysis model significantly outperforms the base SOTA system . <S>
