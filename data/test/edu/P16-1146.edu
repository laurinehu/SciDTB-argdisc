We describe a search algorithm 
for optimizing the number of latent states 
when estimating latent-variable PCFGs with spectral methods . <S>
Our results show 
that contrary to the common belief 
that the number of latent states for each nonterminal in an L-PCFG can be decided in isolation with spectral methods , 
parsing results significantly improve 
if the number of latent states for each nonterminal is globally optimized , 
while taking into account interactions between the different nonterminals . <S>
In addition , we contribute an empirical analysis of spectral algorithms on eight morphologically rich languages : 
Basque , French , German , Hebrew , Hungarian , Korean , Polish and Swedish . <S>
Our results show 
that our estimation consistently performs better or close to coarse-to-fine expectation-maximization techniques for these languages . <S>
