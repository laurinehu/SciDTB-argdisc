State-of-the-art sequence labeling systems traditionally require large amounts of taskspecific knowledge in the form of handcrafted features and data pre-processing . <S>
In this paper , we introduce a novel neutral network architecture 
that benefits from both word- and character-level representations automatically , 
by using combination of bidirectional LSTM , CNN and CRF . <S>
Our system is truly end-to-end , 
requiring no feature engineering or data preprocessing , 
thus making it applicable to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks . <S>
We evaluate our system on two data sets for two sequence labeling tasks 
- Penn Treebank WSJ corpus for part-of-speech ( POS ) tagging and CoNLL 2003 corpus for named entity recognition ( NER ) . <S>
We obtain state-of-the-art performance on both datasets 
- 97.55 % accuracy for POS tagging and 91.21 % F1 for NER . <S>
