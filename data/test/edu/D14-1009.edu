We present STIR ( STrongly Incremental Repair detection ) , a system 
that detects speech repairs 
and edit terms on transcripts incrementally with minimal latency . <S>
STIR uses information-theoretic measures from n-gram models as its principal decision features in a pipeline of classifiers 
detecting the different stages of repairs . <S>
Results on the Switchboard disfluency tagged corpus show utterance-final accuracy on a par with state-of-the-art incremental repair detection methods , but with better incremental accuracy , faster time-to-detection and less computational overhead . <S>
We evaluate its performance 
using incremental metrics 
and propose new repair processing evaluation standards . <S>
