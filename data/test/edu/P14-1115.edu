We propose a novel abstractive querybased summarization system for conversations , 
where queries are defined as phrases 
reflecting a user information needs . <S>
We rank and extract the utterances in a conversation 
based on the overall content and the phrasal query information . <S>
We cluster the selected sentences 
based on their lexical similarity 
and aggregate the sentences in each cluster 
by means of a word graph model . <S>
We propose a ranking strategy 
to select the best path in the constructed graph as a query-based abstract sentence for each cluster . <S>
A resulting summary consists of abstractive sentences 
representing the phrasal query information and the overall content of the conversation . <S>
Automatic and manual evaluation results over meeting , chat and email conversations show 
that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and previous extractive models . <S>
