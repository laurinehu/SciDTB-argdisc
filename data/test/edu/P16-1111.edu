Computationally modeling the evolution of science 
by tracking how scientific topics rise and fall over time 
has important implications for research funding and public policy . <S>
However , little is known about the mechanisms 
underlying topic growth and decline . <S>
We investigate the role of rhetorical framing : 
whether the rhetorical role or function 
that authors ascribe to topics ( as methods , as goals , as results , etc. ) 
relates to the historical trajectory of the topics . <S>
We train topic models and a rhetorical function classifier 
to map topic models onto their rhetorical roles in 2.4 million abstracts from the Web of Science from 1991-2010 . <S>
We find 
that a topic 's rhetorical function is highly predictive of its eventual growth or decline . <S>
For example , topics 
that are rhetorically described as results 
tend to be in decline , 
while topics 
that function as methods 
tend to be in early phases of growth . <S>
