In this paper , we investigate the possibility 
to automatically generate sports news from live text commentary scripts . <S>
As a preliminary study , we treat this task as a special kind of document summarization 
based on sentence extraction . <S>
We formulate the task in a supervised learning to rank framework , 
utilizing both traditional sentence features for generic document summarization and novelly designed task-specific features . <S>
To tackle the problem of local redundancy , 
we also propose a probabilistic sentence selection algorithm . <S>
Experiments on our collected data from football live commentary scripts and corresponding sports news demonstrate the feasibility of this task . <S>
Evaluation results show 
that our methods are indeed appropriate for this task , 
outperforming several baseline methods in different aspects . <S>
