This paper presents neural probabilistic parsing models 
which explore up to third order graph-based parsing with maximum likelihood training criteria . <S>
Two neural network extensions are exploited for performance improvement . <S>
Firstly , a convolutional layer 
that absorbs the influences of all words in a sentence 
is used 
so that sentence-level information can be effectively captured . <S>
Secondly , a linear layer is added 
to integrate different order neural models 
and trained with perceptron method . <S>
The proposed parsers are evaluated on English and Chinese Penn Treebanks 
and obtain competitive accuracies . <S>
