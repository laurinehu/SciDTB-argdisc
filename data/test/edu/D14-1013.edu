Punctuation prediction and disfluency prediction can improve downstream natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and information extraction . <S>
Combining the two tasks can potentially improve the efficiency of the overall pipeline system 
and reduce error propagation . <S>
In this work , we compare various methods 
for combining punctuation prediction ( PU ) and disfluency prediction ( DF ) on the Switchboard corpus . <S>
We compare an isolated prediction approach with a cascade approach , a rescoring approach , and three joint model approaches . <S>
For the cascade approach , we show 
that the soft cascade method is better than the hard cascade method . <S>
We also use the cascade models 
to generate an n-best list , 
use the bi-directional cascade models 
to perform rescoring , 
and compare that with the results of the cascade models . <S>
For the joint model approach , we compare mixed-label Linear-chain Conditional Random Field ( LCRF ) , cross-product LCRF and 2-layer Factorial Conditional Random Field ( FCRF ) with soft-cascade LCRF . <S>
Our results show 
that the various methods 
linking the two tasks 
are not significantly different from one another , 
although they perform better than the isolated prediction method by 0.5-1.5 % in the F1 score . <S>
Moreover , the clique order of features also shows a marked difference . <S>
