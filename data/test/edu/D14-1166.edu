A promising approach to relation extraction , 
called weak or distant supervision , 
exploits an existing database of facts as training data , 
by aligning it to an unlabeled collection of text documents . <S>
Using this approach , 
the task of relation extraction can easily be scaled to hundreds of different relationships . <S>
However , distant supervision leads to a challenging multiple instance , multiple label learning problem . <S>
Most of the proposed solutions to this problem are based on non-convex formulations , 
and are thus prone to local min-ima . <S>
In this article , we propose a new approach to the problem of weakly supervised relation extraction , 
based on discriminative clustering 
and leading to a convex formulation . <S>
We demonstrate 
that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging dataset 
introduced by Riedel et al. ( 2010 ) . <S>
