The informal nature of social media text renders it very difficult to be automatically processed 
by natural language processing tools . <S>
Text normalization , 
which corresponds to restoring the non-standard words to their canonical forms , 
provides a solution to this challenge . <S>
We introduce an unsupervised text normalization approach 
that utilizes not only lexical , but also contextual and grammatical features of social text . <S>
The contextual and grammatical features are extracted from a word association graph 
built by using a large unlabeled social media text corpus . <S>
The graph encodes the relative positions of the words with respect to each other , as well as their part-of-speech tags . <S>
The lexical features are obtained 
by using the longest common subsequence ratio 
and edit distance measures 
to encode the surface similarity among words , 
and the double metaphone algorithm 
to represent the phonetic similarity . <S>
Unlike most of the recent approaches 
that are based on generating normalization dictionaries , 
the proposed approach performs normalization 
by considering the context of the non-standard words in the input text . <S>
Our results show 
that it achieves state-of-the-art F-score performance on standard datasets . <S>
In addition , the system can be tuned 
to achieve very high precision 
without sacrificing much from recall . <S>
