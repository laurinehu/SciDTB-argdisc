Vector space models ( VSMs ) are mathematically well-defined frameworks 
that have been widely used in the distributional approaches to semantics . <S>
In VSMs , high-dimensional vectors represent linguistic entities . <S>
In an application , the similarity of vectors—and thus the entities 
that they represent—
is computed by a distance formula . <S>
The high dimensionality of vectors , however , is a barrier to the performance of methods 
that employ VSMs . <S>
Consequently , a dimensionality reduction technique is employed 
to alleviate this problem . <S>
This paper introduces a novel technique 
called Random Manhattan Indexing ( RMI ) 
for the construction of l1 normed VSMs at reduced dimensionality . <S>
RMI combines the construction of a VSM and dimension reduction into an incremental and thus scalable two-step procedure . <S>
In order to attain its goal , 
RMI employs the sparse Cauchy random projections . <S>
We further introduce Random Manhattan Integer Indexing ( RMII ) : 
a computationally enhanced version of RMI . <S>
As shown in the reported experiments , 
RMI and RMII can be used reliably 
to estimate the l1 distances between vectors in a vector space of low dimensionality . <S>
