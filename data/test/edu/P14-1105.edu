An individual's words often reveal their political ideology . <S>
Existing automated techniques 
to identify ideology from text 
focus on bags of words or wordlists , 
ignoring syntax . <S>
Taking inspiration from recent work in sentiment analysis 
that successfully models the compositional aspect of language , 
we apply a recursive neural network ( RNN ) framework to the task 
of identifying the political position 
evinced by a sentence . <S>
To show the importance of modeling subsentential elements , 
we crowdsource political annotations at a phrase and sentence level . <S>
Our model outperforms existing models on our newly annotated dataset and an existing dataset . <S>
