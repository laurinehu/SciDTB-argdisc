Phrase reordering is a challenge for statistical machine translation systems . <S>
Posing phrase movements as a prediction problem 
using contextual features 
modeled by maximum entropy-based classifier 
is superior to the commonly used lexicalized reordering model . <S>
However , Training this discriminative model 
using large-scale parallel corpus 
might be computationally expensive . <S>
In this paper , we explore recent advancements in solving large-scale classification problems . <S>
Using the dual problem to multinomial logistic regression , 
we managed to shrink the training data 
while iterating 
and produce significant saving in computation and memory 
while preserving the accuracy . <S>
