Much work in recent years has gone into the construction of large knowledge bases ( KBs ) , such as Freebase , DBPedia , NELL , and YAGO . <S>
While these KBs are very large , 
they are still very incomplete , 
necessitating the use of inference 
to fill in gaps . <S>
Prior work has shown how to make use of a large text corpus to augment random walk inference over KBs . <S>
We present two improvements to the use of such large corpora to augment KB inference . <S>
First , we present a new technique 
for combining KB relations and surface text into a single graph representation 
that is much more compact than graphs 
used in prior work . <S>
Second , we describe 
how to incorporate vector space similarity into random walk inference over KBs , 
reducing the feature sparsity inherent in using surface text . <S>
This allows us to combine distributional similarity with symbolic logical inference in novel and effective ways . <S>
With experiments on many relations from two separate KBs , we show 
that our methods significantly outperform prior work on KB inference , both in the size of problem 
our methods can handle and in the quality of predictions made . <S>
