This paper investigates the use of neural networks for the acquisition of selectional preferences . <S>
Inspired by recent advances of neural network models for NLP applications , 
we propose a neural network model 
that learns to discriminate between felicitous and infelicitous arguments for a particular predicate . <S>
The model is entirely unsupervised 
- preferences are learned from unannotated corpus data . <S>
We propose two neural network architectures : 
one that handles standard two-way selectional preferences 
and one that is able to deal with multi-way selectional preferences . <S>
The model's performance is evaluated on a pseudo-disambiguation task , 
on which it is shown to achieve state of the art performance . <S>
