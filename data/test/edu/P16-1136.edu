Modeling relation paths has offered significant gains in embedding models for knowledge base ( KB ) completion . <S>
However , enumerating paths between two entities is very expensive , 
and existing approaches typically resort to approximation with a sampled subset . <S>
This problem is particularly acute 
when text is jointly modeled with KB relations 
and used 
to provide direct evidence for facts 
mentioned in it . <S>
In this paper , we propose the first exact dynamic programming algorithm 
which enables efficient incorporation of all relation paths of bounded length , 
while modeling both relation types and intermediate nodes in the compositional path representations . <S>
We conduct a theoretical analysis of the efficiency gain from the approach . <S>
Experiments on two datasets show 
that it addresses representational limitations in prior approaches 
and improves accuracy in KB completion . <S>
