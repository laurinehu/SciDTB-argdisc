The distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive modification in noun phrases is a well studied subject in linguistics . <S>
Automatically identifying non-restrictive modifiers can provide NLP applications with shorter , more salient arguments , 
which were found beneficial by several recent works . <S>
While previous work showed 
that restrictiveness can be annotated with high agreement , 
no large scale corpus was created , 
hindering the development of suitable classification algorithms . <S>
In this work we devise a novel crowdsourcing annotation methodology , and an accompanying large scale corpus . <S>
Then , we present a robust automated system 
which identifies non-restrictive modifiers , 
notably improving over prior methods . <S>
