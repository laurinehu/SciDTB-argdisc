The automatic detection of causal relationships in text is important for natural language understanding . <S>
This task has proven to be difficult , 
however , due to the need for world knowledge and inference . <S>
We focus on a sub-task of this problem 
where an open class set of linguistic markers can provide clues towards understanding causality . <S>
Unlike the explicit markers , a closed class , 
these markers vary significantly in their linguistic forms . <S>
We leverage parallel Wikipedia corpora 
to identify new markers 
that are variations on known causal phrases , 
creating a training set 
via distant supervision . <S>
We also train a causal classifier 
using features from the open class markers and semantic features 
providing contextual information . <S>
The results show 
that our features provide an 11.05 point absolute increase over the baseline on the task 
of identifying causality in text . <S>
