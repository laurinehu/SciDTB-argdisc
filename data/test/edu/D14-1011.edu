Microblogs have recently received widespread interest from NLP researchers . <S>
However , current tools for Japanese word segmentation and POS tagging still perform poorly on microblog texts . <S>
We developed an annotated corpus 
and proposed a joint model 
for over-coming this situation . <S>
Our annotated corpus of microblog texts enables not only training of accurate statistical models 
but also quantitative evaluation of their performance . <S>
Our joint model with lexical normalization handles the orthographic diversity of microblog texts . <S>
We conducted an experiment 
to demonstrate 
that the corpus and model substantially contribute to boosting accuracy . <S>
