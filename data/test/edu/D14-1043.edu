Language is given meaning through its correspondence with a world representation . <S>
This correspondence can be at multiple levels of granularity or resolutions . <S>
In this paper , we introduce an approach to multi-resolution language grounding in the extremely challenging domain of professional soccer commentaries . <S>
We define and optimize a factored objective function 
that allows us to leverage discourse structure and the compositional nature of both language and game events . <S>
We show 
that finer resolution grounding helps coarser resolution grounding , and vice versa . <S>
Our method results in an F1 improvement of more than 48 % versus the previous state of the art for fine-resolution grounding . <S>
