We introduce submodular optimization to the problem 
of training data subset selection for statistical machine translation ( SMT ) . <S>
By explicitly formulating data selection as a submodular program , 
we obtain fast scalable selection algorithms with mathematical performance guarantees , 
resulting in a unified framework 
that clarifies existing approaches 
and also makes both new and many previous approaches easily accessible . <S>
We present a new class of submodular functions 
designed specifically for SMT 
and evaluate them on two different translation tasks . <S>
Our results show 
that our best submodular method significantly outperforms several baseline methods , 
including the widely-used cross-entropy based data selection method . <S>
In addition , our approach easily scales to large data sets 
and is applicable to other data selection problems in natural language processing . <S>
