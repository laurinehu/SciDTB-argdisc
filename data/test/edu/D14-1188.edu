We introduce new features for incorporating semantic predicate-argument structures in machine translation ( MT ) . <S>
The methods focus on the completeness of the semantic structures of the translations , as well as the order of the translated semantic roles . <S>
We experiment with translation rules 
which contain the core arguments for the predicates in the source side of a MT system , 
and observe 
that using these rules significantly improves the translation quality . <S>
We also present a new semantic feature 
that resembles a language model . <S>
Our results show 
that the language model feature can also significantly improve MT results . <S>
