In this paper , we propose a novel mechanism 
for enriching the feature vector , for the task of sarcasm detection , with cognitive features 
extracted from eye-movement patterns of human readers . <S>
Sarcasm detection has been a challenging research problem , 
and its importance for NLP applications 
such as review summarization , dialog systems and sentiment analysis 
is well recognized . <S>
Sarcasm can often be traced to incongruity 
that becomes apparent 
as the full sentence unfolds . <S>
This presence of incongruity- implicit or explicit- affects the way 
readers eyes move through the text . <S>
We observe the difference in the behaviour of the eye , 
while reading sarcastic and non sarcastic sentences . <S>
Motivated by this observation , 
we augment traditional linguistic and stylistic features for sarcasm detection with the cognitive features 
obtained from readers eye movement data . <S>
We perform statistical classification 
using the enhanced feature set 
so obtained . <S>
The augmented cognitive features improve sarcasm detection by 3.7 % ( in terms of Fscore ) , over the performance of the best reported system . <S>
