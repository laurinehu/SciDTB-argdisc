We present several methods for stemming and lemmatization 
based on discriminative string transduction . <S>
We exploit the paradigmatic regularity of semi-structured inflection tables 
to identify stems in an unsupervised manner with over 85 % accuracy . <S>
Experiments on English , Dutch and German show 
that our stemmers substantially outperform Snowball and Morfessor , 
and approach the accuracy of a supervised model . <S>
Furthermore , the generated stems are more consistent than those 
annotated by experts . <S>
Our direct lemmatization model is more accurate than Morfette and Lemming on most datasets . <S>
Finally , we test our methods on the data from the shared task on morphological reinflection . <S>
