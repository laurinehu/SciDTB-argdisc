State-of-art systems for grammar error correction often correct errors
based on word sequences or phrases . <S>
In this paper , we describe a grammar error correction system 
which corrects grammatical errors at tree level directly . <S>
We cluster all error into two groups 
and divide our system into two modules correspondingly : 
the general module and the special module . <S>
In the general module , we propose a TreeNode Language Model 
to correct errors 
related to verbs and nouns . <S>
The TreeNode Language Model is easy to train 
and the decoding is efficient . <S>
In the special module , two extra classification models are trained 
to correct errors 
related to determiners and prepositions . <S>
Experiments show 
that our system outperforms the state-of-art systems 
and improves the F1 score . <S>
