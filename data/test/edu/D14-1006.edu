In this paper , we present a novel approach 
for identifying argumentative discourse structures in persuasive essays . <S>
The structure of argumentation consists of several components 
( i.e. claims and premises ) 
that are connected with argumentative relations . <S>
We consider this task in two consecutive steps . <S>
First , we identify the components of arguments 
using multiclass classification . <S>
Second , we classify a pair of argument components as either support or non-support 
for identifying the structure of argumentative discourse . <S>
For both tasks , we evaluate several classifiers 
and propose novel feature sets 
including structural , lexical , syntactic and contextual features . <S>
In our experiments , we obtain a macro F1-score of 0.726 
for identifying argument components and 0.722 for argumentative relations . <S>
