Clustering aspect-related phrases in terms of product's property is a precursor process to aspect-level sentiment analysis 
which is a central task in sentiment analysis . <S>
Most of existing methods for addressing this problem are context-based models 
which assume 
that domain synonymous phrases share similar co-occurrence contexts . <S>
In this paper , we explore a novel idea , sentiment distribution consistency , 
which states 
that different phrases ( e.g. "price" , "money" , "worth" , and "cost" ) of the same aspect tend to have consistent sentiment distribution . <S>
Through formalizing sentiment distribution consistency as soft constraint , 
we propose a novel unsupervised model in the framework of Posterior Regularization ( PR ) 
to cluster aspect-related phrases . <S>
Experiments demonstrate 
that our approach outperforms baselines remarkably . <S>
