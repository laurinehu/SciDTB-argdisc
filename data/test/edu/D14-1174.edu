To overcome the scarceness of bilingual corpora for some language pairs in machine translation , 
pivot-based SMT uses pivot language as a `` bridge '' 
to generate source-target translation from source-pivot and pivot-target translation . <S>
One of the key issues is to estimate the probabilities for the generated phrase pairs . <S>
In this paper , we present a novel approach 
to calculate the translation probability 
by pivoting the co-occurrence count of source-pivot and pivot-target phrase pairs . <S>
Experimental results on Europarl data and web data show 
that our method leads to significant improvements over the baseline systems . <S>
