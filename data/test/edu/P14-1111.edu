We explore the extent 
to which high-resource manual annotations such as treebanks are necessary for the task of semantic role labeling ( SRL ) . <S>
We examine 
how performance changes 
without syntactic supervision , 
comparing both joint and pipelined methods 
to induce latent syntax . <S>
This work highlights a new application of unsupervised grammar induction 
and demonstrates several approaches to SRL in the absence of supervised syntax . <S>
Our best models obtain competitive results in the high-resource setting and state-of-the-art results in the low resource setting , 
reaching 72.48 % F1 averaged across languages . <S>
We release our code for this work along with a larger toolkit 
for specifying arbitrary graphical structure . <S>
