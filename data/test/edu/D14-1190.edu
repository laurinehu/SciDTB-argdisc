We propose a model 
for jointly predicting multiple emotions in natural language sentences . <S>
Our model is based on a low-rank coregionalisation approach , 
which combines a vector-valued Gaussian Process with a rich parameterisation scheme . <S>
We show 
that our approach is able to learn correlations and anti-correlations between emotions on a news headlines dataset . <S>
The proposed model outperforms both single-task baselines and other multi-task approaches . <S>
