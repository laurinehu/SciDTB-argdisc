Most of the sequence tagging tasks in natural language processing require to recognize segments with certain syntactic role or semantic meaning in a sentence . <S>
They are usually tackled with Conditional Random Fields ( CRFs ) , 
which do indirect word-level modeling over word-level features 
and thus cannot make full use of segment-level information . <S>
Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields ( Semi-CRFs ) model segments directly 
but extracting segment-level features for Semi-CRFs is still a very challenging problem . <S>
This paper presents Gated Recursive Semi-CRFs ( grSemi-CRFs ) , 
which model segments directly 
and automatically learn segment level features through a gated recursive convolutional neural network . <S>
Our experiments on text chunking and named entity recognition ( NER ) demonstrate 
that grSemi-CRFs generally outperform other neural models . <S>
