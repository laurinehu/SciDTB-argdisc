PCFGs with latent annotations have been shown to be a very effective model for phrase structure parsing . <S>
We present a Bayesian model and algorithms 
based on a Gibbs sampler 
for parsing with a grammar with latent annotations . <S>
For PCFG-LA , we present an additional Gibbs sampler algorithm 
to learn annotations from training data , 
which are parse trees with coarse ( unannotated ) symbols . <S>
We show 
that a Gibbs sampling technique is capable of parsing sentences in a wide variety of languages 
and producing results 
that are on-par with or surpass previous approaches . <S>
Our results for Kinyarwanda and Malagasy in particular demonstrate 
that low-resource language parsing can benefit substantially from a Bayesian approach . <S>
