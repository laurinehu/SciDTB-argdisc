This paper applies type-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) algorithms to the problem of learning Synchronous Context-Free Grammar ( SCFG ) rules from a forest 
that represents all possible rules consistent with a fixed word alignment . <S>
While type-based MCMC has been shown to be effective in a number of NLP applications , 
our setting , 
where the tree structure of the sentence is itself a hidden variable , 
presents a number of challenges to type-based inference . <S>
We describe methods for defining variable types and efficiently indexing variables 
in order to overcome these challenges . <S>
These methods lead to improvements in both log likelihood and BLEU score in our experiments . <S>
